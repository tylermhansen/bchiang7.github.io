# Personal Website Built with Jekyll
Hi there, internet person! Thanks for considering me interesting enough to end up at the repo that contains the code for my personal website.

As you can see, I've forked [bchiang7.github.io](https://github.com/bchiang7/bchiang7.github.io), because Brittany's portfolio sites are some of the best I've ever seen. I'm going to tweak it a bit myself, but credit goes to her for the awesome code I'm starting out with.
